# Lap-Time-Simulation
This is a simple point mass simulation with a single friction coefficient in all direction. 

Note: This project uses an incorrect model of steady state simulations (which confirms my suspicions in getMaxAccelVelocity.m). As such, this project has been abandoned in favor of simulink models.
